        <h4>Why You Need To Check Your Gear:</h4>
        <p>
          The Hauraki Gulf is a nationally-significant marine park. Many of the
          islands of the Gulf are pest free, or partially pest free. This means
          they are now home to some of New Zealand’s rarest and most endangered
          species – eg tuatara, takahe, shore plover and kiwi. The islands are
          also recovering naturally as birds reintroduce themselves to these
          safe havens. It is important to keep them pest free – and we need your
          help!
        </p>
        <p>
          Pest animals and plants can invade our islands by stowing away on or
          in your footwear, gear or boat. Rats can squeeze through a 12 mm gap
          and mice can squeeze through a 7 mm gap. Insects could hide in your
          bag, and weeds, seeds and soil could cling to your clothing and shoes.
        </p>
        <p>Pests threaten New Zealand's native wildlife. Some examples: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rats eat birds, eggs, reptiles and insects.</li>
          <li>Mice prey on insects and eat small birds and reptiles.</li>
          <li>
            Argentine ants can reach large numbers and have a big appetite
            killing our native insects, skinks, geckos and baby birds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plague skinks compete with native lizards and other animals for food
            and habitat and have displaced our native skinks on the mainland.
          </li>
          <li>Soil can carry plant diseases such as kauri dieback.</li>
          <li>Weed seeds can become a weed forest and smother native plants</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Prepare For Your Trip By Being Alert For These Threats.</h4>
        <h4>Please:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure all food is packed and sealed in plastic containers with
            lid. Ensure cardboard boxes are closed and taped – there must be no
            opportunity for an unwanted pest to access the container/box in
            transit.
          </li>
          <li>Ensure all footwear and gear is clean and free of soil.</li>
          <li>
            Thoroughly check any camping or overnight gear for stowaways. Gear
            that has been stored away is high risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thoroughly check seedlings, potting mix or plant matter to ensure
            there are no hitch-hikers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seal up your gear/food as soon as you have finished packing and
            leave it closed until you reach your destination.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Without your co-operation your trip may not be able to take place, so
          if you have any doubts or questions about biosecurity, please ask us.
